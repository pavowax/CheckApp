        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <p>
        The increasing significance of web security prompted the creation of a program to identify vulnerabilities in websites through active, passive, and reputation scanning techniques. In order to maximize their efficacy, active and passive scanning techniques were first studied independently. While passive scanning seeks to gather data without directly dealing with the target system, active scanning finds vulnerabilities through direct engagement with target systems. Reputation scanning assesses a website's dependability and past hazardous activity. By combining these three approaches, a more thorough and efficient security evaluation is intended to be produced, leading to the creation of a reliable tool for ensuring website security.
